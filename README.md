# Buffon's Needle

This project is a p5.js sketch that simulates Buffon's Needle experiment.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```sh
cd your-repo-name
```

## Running the Project 
**Method 1: Directly Open index.html**
Open the 'index.html' file directly in your web browser.

If you are stuck on a Loading... screen or an error occurs, follow Method 2. 

**Method 2: Using a Local Server**
1. **Open terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
```sh
cd path/to/projectdirectory
```
3. **Start a local server.**
```sh
python3 -m http.server
```
Once your terminal/command prompt outputs Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...

Open your web browser and go to 
```sh
http://localhost:8000
```

## Voila! The project should be running now. I have found that by letting the space between each vertical line to a distance of 20 and each needle length to be length 10 we get the most accuracte approximation of *pi* But feel free to play around with the lengths and distances.
